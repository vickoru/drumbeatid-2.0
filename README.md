# drumbeatID

drumbeatID is a project I started developing when I was completing a data science bootcamp a couple of years back. Its main purpose is to develop a deep learning algorithm that classifies drumming styles from a WAV audiofile. 

## Project status and roadmap 

The project is still in progress. 

The goals of this project are: 
- Develop the scripts necessary to preprocess WAV files to extract segments of custom duration in seconds as input samples for the deep learning algorithm.
- Develop the scripts to extract audio sample features, with particular emphasis on spectrograms as input for training the algorithm.
- Train a convolutional neural network to classify drumming styles based on spectrograms as input.
- Generation of short duration drum beats of a particular drumming style via training of a variational autoencoder or diffusion models.
